U Compiler Wish List
--------------------
This is a non-comprehensive list of features I'm planning to add to the compiler
if I ever have time and become less lazy:

* a "define" preprocessor feature (this would work much like #define in C)
* global variables - I have a bit of a personal vendetta against these from my
	training and experience in software engineering, but for a language like
	this, they seem almost (gasp) inevitable
* more assembly code in asm blocks - Right now only "mov" and "int" are supported,
	and I'd like to support a greater subset of the syntax
